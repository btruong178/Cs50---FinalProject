# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Ultimate Tetris"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of tetris with new blocks added and/or a bigger arena.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be using Python to code a game of tetris with a twist. New blocks and/or a bigger arena. Just like a game of Tetris it will randomize the blocks given to you and you must have a complete layer of blocks for it to disaapear
and you will lose if any of the blocks touch the top.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Diana Truong, tug54338@temple.edu, Joanne Nichols

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The arena of the tetris game and creating the blocks to be able to stack ontop of eachother.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to complete majority of the tetris game including win conditions and representing the next blocks to come, on the side, like a regular game of tetris.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything of a game of tetris plus a bigger arena and extra blocks, and also being able to hold the down button and have it travel faster.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will most likely be using python with pygame to create tetris and do more research on how to use pygame since I'm unfamiliar with it. We will be mostly working together rather than separating work since we
both need to know what needs to be done. But when an obstacle arrives we will probably divide the work into researching and experimenting with different code.
